# This is a list of proprietary files that are part
# of the grouper vendor blobs, listed by vendor
# package. Files commented out will not be copied
# to the kai vendor files. Uncommented files will
# be carried over.
# Some files have kai blob counterparts with
# different names. These probably are:
#	kai			grouper
#	gps.tegra.so		gps.tegra3.so
#	gralloc.tegra.so	gralloc.tegra3.so
#	hwcomposer.tegra.so	hwcomposer.tegra3.so
#	nvram_4330.txt		nvram.txt
# Perhaps the best way of dealing with this is to
# add one of the above to the vendor tree. and add
# a symlink later on in the build process, by including
# them in product_copy_files in an additional makefile.
# Also, the easiest way of dealing with the associated
# module definitions is really to use sed when we're
# adding the kai alternatives...
